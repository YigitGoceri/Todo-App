## TodoApp Demo

You can access my project=> [PROJECT LINK](https://todoapp-git-main-yigitgoceri.vercel.app/).

#I built this app by using React JS

#You can add tasks to the list and click the task if it is completed.

#Clean items button only works for completed tasks.

#I also used localstorage in this app to keep tasks in the local storage in your machine.#
